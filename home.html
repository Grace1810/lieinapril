               Kōsei is a former child prodigy in playing piano, dubbed the "Human Metronome" for his near-inhuman mechanical accuracy, a product of his mother Saki's overly strict methods of teaching. His ability to play the piano with unparalleled precision led him to win many competitions across Japan and even be invited to play abroad. When Saki died, the resulting psychological trauma caused him to be unable to hear the sound of his piano playing, and he gave up on it. Two years later, he takes up the piano again after being convinced by Kaori Miyazono to become her accompanist. Influenced by her emotional and unrestrained playing style, Kōsei eventually finds himself falling in love with her. He, however, does not confess his feelings due to his belief that she likes his best friend, Ryota Watari, which is later revealed to be a lie just to get close to him.
               It is later revealed in Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso: Coda, a side story from Kōsei and Tsubaki's childhood, that his inspiration for playing so beautifully in his first competition was to cheer up Tsubaki after the passing of her grandmother.</p>

           Kaori is Tsubaki's classmate; she is a free-spirited violinist who has drawn much criticism from judging panels due to her unwillingness to adhere strictly to the score, but is highly favored by audiences that hear her playing. Kaori first met Kōsei when she asked Tsubaki to set her up with Watari. As their friendship grew, she eventually convinced Kōsei to play the piano again, first as her accompanist and later in a piano competition. It is revealed at the end of the anime, in a letter addressed to Kōsei after her death, that she had asked to be set up with Watari in order to meet Kōsei, knowing that Watari and Tsubaki were good friends of his and that she had been in love with him since she was five, and merely thought Watari as a friend.</p>
